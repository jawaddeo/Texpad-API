# Texpad API

### Introduction

Texpad-API.framework is a typesetting API that enables any iOS application to typeset LaTeX documents using Texpad's builtin LaTeX typesetter.

Please note that the API server was only added to Texpad 1.5.  This API will not work with earlier versions of Texpad.

### Example project

The "Texpad API Test" folder contains an example project that demonstrates this API.  You will need to alter the bundle id, and provide your own provision profile in order to install it on your device.

### Getting started guide

To add this library to your project, you need only add the framework to your XCode project.  Having selected the relevant target, choose the "Build Phases" pane, open the "Link Binary with Libraries" leaf and press the "+" button to add a framework.  Next choose "Add other ..." and navigate to Texpad-API.framework.

The framework's include statement is

    #import <TexpadAPI/TexpadAPI.h>


###### Choose a URL Scheme

Next it is necessary to choose a return URL scheme, that Texpad will use to pass the typeset document back to your application. This MUST be prefixed with `tpapi-` and the remainder should be unique to your application.  Once you have chosen one (for example tpapi-testapp) please add it to your info.plist.

	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>tpapi-testapp</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>

When you first instantiate the TPAPIManager object it will search through your Application's info.plist to find this url scheme, hence the requirement that it must be prefixed with `tpapi-`.  It will throw an exception if no URL scheme is found.  We suggest a reverse-DNS style approach to naming here.

Please note that all access to the API must be through the singleton object returned by [TPAPIManager sharedManager].

###### Add handler hook to Application Delegate's handleOpenURL:

Once the URL scheme is entered into the info.plist you must add a handler hook to the UIApplicationDelegate's application:handleOpenURL: method

    -(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
        if ([[TPAPIManager sharedManager] handleOpenURL:url]) {
            return YES;
        }

        // handle other URLs here
        
        return NO;
    }

This will intercept the url's matching Texpad API's naming scheme, unpack them and pass them to `[TPAPIManager sharedManager]`'s delegate.  All other urls will be ignored.

####### Set TPAPIManager's delegate

When a typeset request is returned from Texpad, it will be passed to `[TPAPIManager sharedManager]`'s delegate.

Implement the `TPAPIManagerDelegate` protocol, in an object then set this object as the shared manager's delegate

    @interface SomeObject : SomeSuperclass <TPAPIManagerDelegate> {

    . . .

    SomeObject *obj = [[SomeObject alloc] â€¦
    [TPAPIManager sharedManager].delgate = obj;

Please note that when the delegate is nil, TPAPIManager will queue any returned requests, so that they are not lost.  They will be delivered when the delegate is set for the first time.

This is done because although very unlikely, there is no guarantee once an application goes out of focus, that iOS will not decide to terminate it.  Whilst typesetting your application will briefly be out of focus.  In the unlikely case that iOS runs out of memory and terminates your application this guarantees that any pending typeset requests will not be lost.

####### Check that Texpad is installed

You can verify whether Texpad is installed or not by calling typesetterPresent on this shared object

    if ([[TPAPIManager sharedManager] typesetterPresent]) {
        // action if API found
    } else {
        // action if API not found
    }

###### Submit a request

Once everything is setup you can submit your request

    // create object
    TPAPIRequest *request = [[TPAPIRequest alloc] init];
    
    // add a single latex file
    NSString *rootFile = @"\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHello world\n\\end{document}\n";
    [request addData:[rootFile dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]
              atPath:@"root.tex"];

You may add as many latex, image or other data files as you like.  By default the first file added will be considered the root file for typeset purposes, but you can customise this default with the `rootFilePath` field.

If your application may be submitting multiple requests (not recommended), or if you want to handle the possibility that iOS may terminate your application when it goes out focus during typeset, then we recommend that you assign an ID using the `tag` field of the TPAPIRequest object.

When ready, dispatch the request via the typeset manager

    [[TPAPIManager sharedManager] submitRequest:request];

Your application will go out of focus briefly whilst the request is typeset, and when finished Texpad will pass focus back to your application.  It does not provide the user with any choices, or anything that would cause the focus to fail to return to your application.

###### Handle the returned request

You handle the returned request in the delegate's typesetRequestComplete: method

    -(void)typesetRequestComplete:(TPAPIRequest*)request {
        NSLog(@"Request %ld returned", request.tag);

        if (request.status == TPAPIRequestStatusSuccess) {
            NSLog(@"success!");

            // show log on console
            NSLog(@"%@", request.typesetLog);
        } else if (request.status == TPAPIRequestStatusTypesetFailure) {
            NSLog(@"typeset failed!");

            // show log on console
            NSLog(@"%@", request.typesetLog);
        } else if (request.status == TPAPIRequestStatusFailure) {
            NSLog(@"other failure!");
        }
    }

### Full Documentation

The most detailed, and up to date, documentation is available in the header files of the framework in Doxygen format.

### Contact 

If you have any questions, or trouble integrating this framework into your application, or suggestions for improvement please get in contact with us at <support@vallettaventures.com>.

We'd also love to hear about anybody that is using the Texpad API, so that we can maintain a list of client applications on our website.
